<b>Work in progress!</b>
Right now this deck only contains the vocabulary from the first Lecture of Genki 2, but more will be added.

This deck is part of a series:
Genki 1: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1742947823
Genki 2 (WIP): https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/969261095

This deck was generated via python. Contributions welcome.

For learing kanji I recommend this deck: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/95480491" rel="nofollow">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/95480491</a>

The main source for the vocabulary of this deck is the Genki I Deck from here:
